dmvpn - dynamic multipoint virtual private network

branch_a (main site)...

prep the main site with some local interfaces to emulate a LAN Like sites 1 and 2....

local ospf branch_a side...

------ DMVPN

- mGRE interface
- source ip is wan public
- dmvpn based on NHRP, like arp, to resolve next hops
- nhrp net-id, this dmvpn, all endpoints must have some network-id 1
- spokes are NH clients of the NH server in the nhrp protocol
- 192.168.0.1 - main site tunnel ip
- 10.10.2.2   - main site public ip on wan
- NOTICE, we do not have a tunnel DESTINATION ! nor anything about the spokes config'd here at the 
hub site...

r1 and r2 spoke sites...

- spoke sites must have hub site info
- spoke sites do not need to have other spoke info
- 
- 192.168.0.1 - main site tunnel ip
- 10.10.2.2   - main site public ip on wan
- f0/0/0      - wan interface incase we have ip change due to dhcp
- 192.168.0.2 - spoke site 1 tunnel ip
- 192.168.0.3 - spoke site 2 tunnel ip

r1 and r2... same except for tunnel ip!

verify...

sh dmvpn
sh dmvpn detail
sh interf tun 0
interface is multipoint-GRE

hub sees spokes as dymically built...

nice that it scales with no need to configure spokes from hub side

from branch 1
ping 192.168.0.2
ping 192.168.0.3

from r1 or r2, ping other... see dynamic tunnel direct to remote...

like from r1...
ping 192.168.0.3

sh dmvpn to see dynamic spoke

also, ping self and TRACEROUTE... interesting that you have to go to the NHRP server to resolve your own up... except the NHS itself...revolves locally

now let's add tunnel 0 to ospf

first on dsw1....
ping 192.168.20.1 re 100000

branch_a...

...jump back to branch_a real quick, see neighbor up...

sh ip ospf int br
sh ip ospf ne

now dsw1 LAN can ping lo1 on branch_a....

* PROBLEM!

OSPF STARTS FLAPPING ON THIS R2 and previous R1 and dsw1 looses ability to ping branch LAN loopback

hurry and turn it off on r2....

no network 192.168.0.3 0.0.0.0 area 0

fix....
...NOTIVE default tunnel interface is P2P...

BranchA#sh ip ospf int tun 0
Tunnel0 is up, line protocol is up
  Internet Address 192.168.0.1/24, Area 0, Attached via Network Statement
  Process ID 1, Router ID 192.168.2.1, Network Type POINT_TO_POINT, Cost: 1000

OSPF over DMVPN works if tunnel interfaces are reconfig'd as BROADCAST network type...

let's fix previous r1 and branch_a, also put on r2....

conf t
int tun 0
ip ospf network broadcast

BE PATIENT FOR NEIGHBORSHIP AND DSW1 pings...

now do r2 ospf....

------------------------------------
(btw, if we didn't first delete that gre tunnel in the previous lab, you will see a message like this....
...
*Apr 16 18:06:52.332: %TUN-4-VALIDATE_TUNNEL_CONFIG: The configured tunnel src is being shared by multiple
     features on the device. Ex: Tunnel1 & Tunnel0. This configuration has
     the potential to introduce forwarding issues.
...
which is why we deleted it first)
