*** circle back on the multicast statement on the tunnel interfaces... adding one more of those on r1 and r2 allow them to ospf neighbor directly.... even though it's not needed for the shortcut spoke to spoke auto tunnel, it does allow more control plane logic to exist between spokes, such that if the ospf control plane had issues on the dmvpn hub router, it would now not affect r1 and r2 ability to maintain ospf states....

* scenario is, wan provider is selling 1 mbps of service to Company A at Site 1

* 1 mbps seems small but, it's only because I need small scale to simulate qos in the lab

* if we had a traffic generator that could simulate 100 mbps or 1 gbps, then we could scale up our qos tools

* but the concepts remain the same

ISP_A side... provider would be rate limiting your traffic per what you buy...

* using MQC style QoS toolset...
- class-map
- policy-map
- service-policy
* nothing until it's attached to interface
* show what we can match on
* show what we can police on
* mention where to apply it, as ISP has phy int with vlan and then L3 SVI...
* try phy int first...

* FIRST, ping from site 1 to main site
* big packet size to generate some traffic...

asw1...
ping 192.168.20.1 re 100000000 size 10000

* on ISP_A verify rate before and after...

%Error: FastEthernet0/3/0 Service Policy Configuration Failed.Only Match with access group is supported

* we used access-group...
do sh run | sec class-map
* FIX, remove previous protocol ip....

class-map match-all my-policer
no match protocol ip
do sh run | sec class-map

------ 3rd try ---------------
interface FastEthernet0/3/0
 service-policy input my-policer

%Error: Service policy cannot be supported -
Rules required exceed available resources in ASIC.

* back to the drawing board... 
* we know that this connection for SITE 1 is provided via f0/3/0
* ...but we also know it's a vlan, routed at L3 SVI Vlan101
* try there
* ASW 1 still pining ?

------- 4th try ----------------
interface Vlan101
 service-policy input my-policer

* WORKS !
* NOW that traffic is viloating (exceeding contract)
* pings dropping on ASW1
* on IPS_A
sh policy-map int vlan 101
