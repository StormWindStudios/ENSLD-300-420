bidir pim introduces the concept of "phantom RP" in which the RP actual doesn't perform any function other than being a vector that bidir rp uses to converge on.  it can be a subnet id or actual router, but either will work...


sh ip pim interface f0/0/0 df

...all routers...

en 
conf t
ip pim bidir-enable
ip pim rp-address 10.1.1.0 bidir

...give it time, branch_a will re-join....

verify...

sh ip pim rp mapping
...shows bidir mode...

sh ip mroute
...shows bidir mroutes...
