* ORIENT TO THE LAB L2, L3, MCAST

* as always, the network exists to provide a service
... and in the case of mcast it's for sources and receivers

* to begin, as a network admin, engineer you may not control end points....

* but you can test both functions with IOS
- source... simply ping a multicast address

- multicast source	- ping 239.255.1.1 re 1000000	
- multicast receiver 	- ip igmp join-group 239.255.1.1
(more later)

initial setup...

all routers must have global mcast routing enabled...
ip multicast-routing

some MLS/L3-switches like our lab 3750 requires...
ip multicast-routing distributed

* all mcast interfaces need pim enabled... LAN AND MCAST SOURCE ALSO
pim mode enabled per interface and loopback

modes... 
sparse		- PIM-SM, BiDir, SSM
dense		- PIM-DM
sparse-dense	- auto-rp

* we will setup PIM-SM first...

pimv2 hellos , 224.0.0.13

dsw1 and dsw2... compare
sh ip int vl 10 
what you see on this dsw1 vlan 10 as you might recall from previous lessons....this isn't network wide ip multicast, but it is link local mcast groups that this route is participating in .... ospf, pimv2, igmp, all routes and all hosts mcast

DR - default priority 1, tiebreaker highest IP wins

look on DSW1...

sh ip pim neighbor g1/0/13
sh cdp ne g1/0/13
sh ip pim interface GigabitEthernet1/0/13
sh ip pim interface GigabitEthernet1/0/13

you can use interface ip pim passive if you are sure you do not need to estalish pim neighborship

* let's look at what mrouting looks like prior to setting up the RP...

DSW1 Example...

sh ip mroute
built-in automatic 224.0.1.40 is used for Auto-RP (more later)

on dsw2 mcast source....
ping 239.255.1.1 re 1000000

(START PING AND SHOW first hop (DSW1) mroute table)
...then...
ping 239.255.1.2 re 1
ping 239.255.1.3 re 1
ping 239.255.1.4 re 1
ping 239.255.1.5 re 1

debug ip mrouting
sh ip pim rp
...no rp...

- receiver... BRANCH_A
ip igmp join-group 239.255.1.1
(check first hop, R2)

...just so you don't think they are related to the source test...
ip igmp join-group 239.255.1.201
ip igmp join-group 239.255.1.202
ip igmp join-group 239.255.1.203
ip igmp join-group 239.255.1.204
ip igmp join-group 239.255.1.205

R2...
sh ip pim rp
sh ip mroute

moving on to static RP
